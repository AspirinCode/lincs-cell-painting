# Drug Repurposing Hub Compound Information

These data were retrieved from the [Drug Repurposing Hub CLUE Resource](https://clue.io/repurposing).

Verbatim from this resource:

> The dataset available in the Repurposing Hub contains comprehensive annotations for a total of 6,125 compounds: 2,369 Launched drugs, 1,619 drugs that reached phases 1-3 of clinical development, 96 compounds that were previously approved but withdrawn from use, and 2,041 preclinical or tool compounds.
Annotations specifically include compound name, chemical structure, clinical trial status, mechanism of action, protein targets, disease areas, approved indications (where applicable), purity of the purchased sample, and vendor ID.

**The `lincs_cell_painting` repository contains a subset of these compounds profiled in one cell line (A549).**
